# VIQUAC

Virtual Qualitiy Assessment for Composites (VIQUAC) is a software that determines the volume fraction of fiber or resin 
and calculates the mechanical behavior of the material by Classical Lamination Theory (CLT).


## Libraries

Were used in VIQUAC.

## Basic Methodology
  Using the image processing methods to predict quality assessment of composite materials and predict the mechanical behavior according to Classical Lamination Theory(CLT).
